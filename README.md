# AviatorBuster
Aviator Buster is a desktop application built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and MahApps.Metro for the UI design, with LiveCharts for data visualization. The app is designed to track and predict outcomes based on user input data from the Aviator game.

Key Features:
Scatter Plot Visualization: Displays game data on a scatter chart, with points representing tracked data values.
Live Data Input: Users can input game data, which is dynamically added to a historical list and plotted on the scatter chart.
Prediction Algorithm: As data is added, the app uses an internal algorithm to predict potential outcomes based on past inputs.
Historical Data Tracking: Displays a list of the latest game data inputs, removing the oldest entry once the list exceeds 50 items.
Responsive UI: The app provides real-time feedback on data input and updates the scatter chart accordingly.

This application can be extended to integrate more complex predictive models and further visualizations to help users track and analyze their game data more effectively.
